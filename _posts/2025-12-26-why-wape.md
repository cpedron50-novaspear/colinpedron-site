WAPE (Weighted Absolute Percentage Error) is the metric I reach for first when:

- demand is lumpy
- the business cares about **total** error impact
- you need something explainable without a stats lecture

### When I use it
- S&OP reviews
- SKU portfolios where volume mix matters
- “Are we getting better?” tracking

### When I don’t
If your volume is near-zero for lots of items, WAPE can behave weirdly. In that case, I’ll pair it with something like MAE, bias, or a “top movers” lens.
